I’m so excited to share Love the Earth with you! This advice book helps kids learn why climate change is a problem and how they can use their unique passions and talents to make a difference. It’s chock-full of quizzes, crafts, activities, and some of the cutest illustrations you’ll ever see in a climate change book.

Every day during this project, I learned something new and surprising about climate change. For example, did you know that educating girls is one of the best ways to combat climate change, according to [Project Drawdown](https://drawdown.org/solutions/health-and-education)? (That definitely made this project feel worthwhile!) And did you know that just 100 companies are responsible for over 70% of greenhouse gas emissions since 1988, according to [CDP](https://www.cdp.net/en/articles/media/new-report-shows-just-100-companies-are-source-of-over-70-of-emissions)? In other words, fighting climate change is going to take a lot more than putting our plastic bottles in the recycling bin, despite what big companies want us to think.

My favorite pages feature real girls working hard to make the earth a better place. I had so much fun researching and talking to real girls like Lexine, an eleven-year-old girl standing up for the Gwich’in way of life in Alaska, and thirteen-year-old Genesis, who fights climate change through a vegan diet. The youth climate movement is powerful, and I hope this book can inspire even more young people to speak up and make a difference.
