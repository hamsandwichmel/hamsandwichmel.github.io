Hi! My name is Mel, and I write and edit books for kids. My favorite things are trees, rainbows, and dairy-free ice cream. In my opinion, the funniest thing in the world is when food is in places where it’s not supposed to be, like a hotdog in your backpack or a banana on a playground swing.

I live in Madison, Wisconsin, where I worked as a content development editor for American Girl for four years. It was pretty much the best job in the world! I wrote advice and activity books, edited fiction books, and once received a two-pound tub of marshmallows as a birthday gift.  

Now, I’m a freelance writer and editor, available to work on children’s fiction, nonfiction, and activity books. If you hire me for a project, you’ll get to meet my two feline coworkers, Purrogi and Io. They have a variety of skills, including screaming. Let’s work together! 

P.S. I’m represented by Tracey Adams at [Adams Literary](http://www.adamsliterary.com/).
