Hi! My name is Mel, and I write and edit books for kids.  My favorite things are trees, rainbows, and dairy-free ice cream. In my opinion, the funniest thing in the world is when food is in places where it’s not supposed to be, like a hotdog in your backpack.

I live in Madison, Wisconsin, where I work as a content editor for American Girl. It’s pretty much the funnest job in the world. One time, my coworkers bought me a two-pound tub of rainbow marshmallows for my birthday, and I named her Marsh.

## About Mel’s Cats

{% include image-left image_path="images/profile/mel_niko.jpg" name="Mel & Niko" %}

I have two gray cats named Niko (age 10) and Purrogi (age 1). Niko is stern and elegant, and his favorite food is butter. Purrogi is silly and clumsy, and he often does a somersault when he jumps at a toy too fast.
