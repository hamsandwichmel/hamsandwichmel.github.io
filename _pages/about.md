# About Mel
<img src="/images/site/mel_headshot.jpeg" alt="Mel smiling with a rainbow background" class="image-left" style="max-width: 35%; height: auto;">
**Mel Hammond** is an award-winning author of fiction and nonfiction for kids and young adults. Whether she's writing about murderous multi-level marketing cults, road trip shenanigans, or climate change activism, she likes to keep things a little silly. She lives in Madison, Wisconsin, where she writes in a tangerine-orange office with two feline assistants.

# About Mel and Teghan

<img src="/images/site/mel_teeg_home.jpeg" alt="Teghan and Mel laugh in the grass while talking on banana phones" class="image-right" style="max-width: 45%; height: auto;">


**Teghan Hammond** and **Mel Hammond** are sisters who grew up punching each other whenever they saw a P.T. Cruiser, dying their hair blue together, and fabricating a fake band in which their middle brother was (allegedly) the lead singer. Writing Lucy, Uncensored was their first time co-writing. Unless you count the summer they spent scribbling down recipes for the strangest sandwiches you’ve ever heard of, like the Tax Exemption Wrap (Teghan) and the Nail Gun Sandwich (Mel).

Today, **Teghan** lives in northern Indiana, where she drinks excessive amounts of coffee and volunteers for LGBTQIA+ causes. When she’s not tearing down gender norms, Teghan is probably watching cartoons or gaming. **Mel** lives in Madison, Wisconsin, where she writes books in a tangerine-orange office. Besides writing, she loves walking in the woods and eating dairy-free ice cream. Between the two of them, Teghan and Mel have four adorable cats. 


P.S. We're both represented by Tracey Adams at [Adams Literary](http://www.adamsliterary.com/).
